## 1768. Merge Strings Alternately
You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

```
Example 1:

Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r

```

## Solution

```jsx
var mergeAlternately = function(word1, word2) {
let nstr = ""
let max = Math.max(word1.length , word2.length)
let i = 0 
 while( i < max ){
    if(word1[i] != undefined){
        nstr+=word1[i]
    }
    if(word2[i] != undefined){
        nstr+=word2[i]
    }
    i++
 }
  return nstr
};
```

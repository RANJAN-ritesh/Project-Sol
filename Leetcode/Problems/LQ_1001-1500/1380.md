## 1380. Lucky Numbers in a Matrix

Given an m x n matrix of distinct numbers, return all lucky numbers in the matrix in any order.

A lucky number is an element of the matrix such that it is the minimum element in its row and maximum in its column.

 
```
Example 1:

Input: matrix = [[3,7,8],[9,11,13],[15,16,17]]
Output: [15]
Explanation: 15 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row and the maximum in its column.
```

## Solution 

```jsx

var luckyNumbers  = function(matrix) {

    let mins = []
    
    for(let i = 0  ; i<matrix.length ; i++){
        let min = Infinity
        for(let j = 0 ; j<matrix[i].length ; j++){
             if(matrix[i][j]<min){
                min = matrix[i][j]
             }
        }
        mins.push(min)
    }

    let maxs = []
   for (let i = 0; i < matrix[0].length; i++) {
        let max = 0 
    for (let j = 0; j < matrix.length; j++) {
        if(matrix[j][i] > max){
            max = matrix[j][i]

        }
    }
       maxs.push(max)
     
}

   let fin = maxs.filter((ele)=>{
    return mins.includes(ele)}
    )

   return fin

};
```

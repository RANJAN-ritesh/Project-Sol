## 389. Find the Difference

You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

 
```
Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
```

## Solution

```jsx

var findTheDifference = function(s, t) {
   let str = (s+t)

   let obj = {}

   for(let i = 0 ; i <str.length ; i++){
    if(obj[str[i]]){
        obj[str[i]]++
    }else{
        obj[str[i]] = 1
    }
   }

  
   for(let key in obj){
    if(obj[key]%2 == 1){
        return key
    }
   }


};
```
